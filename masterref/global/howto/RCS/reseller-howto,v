This document is a work in progress. Please check the edit date in the

information is probably outdated.

Resellers for Lunar Hosting services are handled in a very manual method
for the time being. A directory called, /etc/resellers has been created 
to address the issue in a more dynamic method in the future.

For now however, its best to read through the /etc/resellers/resellers.conf
file to grab information on a particular group.

Two important items that should be addressed are.

 1. Reseller IDs
    A reseller id is what will identify this reseller in any scripts
    ran on the server. Of most importance is the '--reseller' flag on
    the 'newclient' script. If the domain being installed is NOT a
    Lunar Hosting customer, the --reseller flag should be used and
    have a value set to one of the entries held within the [brackets]
    of the resellers.conf file. For example a domain set up for 
    Donna's House of Type would use the syntax:

      newclient --add --domain DOMAIN --reseller dhot

 2. Invoice E-Mail Addresses
    Do NOT, DO NOT use these e-mail addresses. In the final version
    of our billing script, these addresses will be used to send 
    invoices to customers. These addresses will be send as BCC, so 
    the reseller should NEVER be aware that they exist. Do NOT use
    them!
