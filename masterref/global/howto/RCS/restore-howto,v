In a disaster situation, there is no easy method of pushing backup files
to a remote host. You must restore the files from the backup directory
to the remote host using scp. You may scp the files directly from name2 
to the remote machine or you may first tar up the files needed and then
scp them to the remote host.

Since our servers run SSH on an alternate port, you will need to use the
-P flag with scp to specify the port:

  scp -P 8228 <origin> <destination>

To scp a file to a remote machine, an example would be:

  scp -P 8228 sendmail.cf host1:/etc/mail/sendmail.cf

This will be changed in the future to use a frontend script.
