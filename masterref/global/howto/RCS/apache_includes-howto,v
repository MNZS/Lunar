@SYNOPSIS
  This document covers the /include/ subdirectory and its contents 
  within the /usr/local/apache/conf directory structure.

USAGE
  Most all features of client hosting domains are held within 
  include files that are called from within the domain-specific
  configuration file. Each include file is created from a template
  file specific to that aspect of the apache configuration it concerns.
  This allows for standardization across each client, and allows for
  features to be added/removed from configurations with a simple 
  addition or removal of a comment in the domains configuration file

  A brief synopsis of the directory structure is as follows:

    /usr/local/apache/conf/include/ - base directory for includes

      |_ /virtual/    directory holding the root configurations for 
                      all client domains

      |_ /global/     directory holding include files that are called
                      from within the main httpd.conf file or can be
                      applied to each of the client virtual files
                      without customization

      |_ /commerce/   directory holding include files relating to 
                      e-commerce configurations

        |_ /miva/     directory holding include to enable the miva
                      shopping cart for a site

        |_ /shopzone/ directory holding include to enable the 
                      shopzone shopping cart for a site

        |_ /process/  directory holding include to enable the 
                      process.cgi secure form script

      |_ /features/   directory holding includes to enable non-global
                      features on a per site basis

        |_ /php/      directory holding include to enable php

        |_ /asp/      direcotry hodling include to enable asp

      |_ /bugfix/     directory holding includes for global bugfixes that
                      will be applied universally 

  For more understanding of what the includes bring to each configuration,
  please read through the "template" file held within each directory
