The /etc/mail/virtuser file should seldomly be edited by hand. It is built
via the mkmail script from the virtuser include files located in

  /etc/mail/include/virtuser/virt.*

These include files may be edited by hand, but only in circumstances that
demand administrative intervention. These files should be owned by 'nobody'
to allow for editing throught the control panel.

If a file is edited, mkmail should be ran immediately after to put the 
change into effect.
