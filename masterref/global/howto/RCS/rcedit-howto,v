Most important files on the Lunar Hosting servers are RCS protected.
This means that each file has multiple revisions of itself archived
within the RCS tree to allow for backing out of a fat-fingered config 
or reverting to a prior revision for some administrative purpose. 

To find out if a file is RCS protected, first look in the file

 /masterbin/sources

on name2.lunarhosting.net. If the file is in this list, DO NOT edit
the file locally on the server where you are working. This is a 
masterref guarded file and should be edited only through the masterref
process. Read through the masterref-howto to find out more.
If the file is not in the list, you can simply perform a 'ls RCS' in
the directory where the files resides.
If you see the same file name appeneded with ",v" in the RCS directory,
then the file IS rcs protected and should only be edited via "rcedit".
If the file is not present in the RCS directory, it is safe to edit
with the editor of your choice.

RCEDIT is a perl wrapper for the RCS ci and co commands for checking
files in and out of RCS. The wrapper will check a file out and allow 
you to edit the file using 'vi'. Once you have written the file and
exited vi, you will then be prompted for an rcs log entry if you made
any changes to the file. You may enter as long and as descriptive a
message as you see fit. Once you have entered all the description that
you would like, you can exit the log entry by entering a single period
on a blank log entry line. This will return you to the command line.
