@**** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED ***

How DNS responsibilities are enabled within the Server Distribution

o Master nameservers are ns1.lunarhosting.net and ns2.lunarhosting.net.
  These nameservers allow for recursive queries for the Fast Monster
  Wireless network. They also allow for queries regarding all Lunar 
  Hosting customer domains.

o Hosting servers, e.g. hostX.lunarhosting.net, will allow queries 
  for their locally hosted domains. In theory, no queries will come
  directly to them, instead, the world will send queries to ns1 and ns2.

  Hosting servers update nsX with a new list of domains it should be
  considered authoritative for, each time a new client is added. the
  update takes place using the zoneupdate script. 

o To summarize. ns1 and ns2 are slave servers to both host1 and host2.
  ns1 and ns2 are listed publicly as the authoritative servers for
  all hosted domains.
  The hosting servers are each master nameservers, however they are 
  not seen as authoritative by the world.

o Read through named_update-howto for more on the inter-server communication
