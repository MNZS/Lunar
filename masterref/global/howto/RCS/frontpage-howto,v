This document covers how to install, upgrade and troubleshoot frontpage
server extensions for the apache webserver on the Lunar Hosting webservers.

Apache Frontpage Server Extensions are developed by a company called 
Ready to Run Software. Their homepage can be found at www.rtr.com. Although
this company created the extensions for Apache, they did a poor job at
documenting them. There is an FAQ and a bulletin board on the website that
do provide some information, however it is mediocre at best.

* Installation
To enable frontpage extensions for a brand new website, the 'mkfp' script
was created. This script is meant to be used as a method for installing 
frontpage extensions on a BRAND NEW website, and NOT meant to be used to
re-install extensions on a website. The syntax is as follows

  mkfp --install DOMAIN.COM

Substitute the actual customer's domain WITHOUT the 'www' for the DOMAIN.COM
portion of the command line. An example would be

  mkfp --install lunarhosting.net

This script makes several changes to the customer's website directory as
well as to the httpd configuration files. Run this script carefully!

During the script's run, you will be prompted for a Frontpage Username and
Password. Enter them at the prompt when you are requested. Once you have 
completed entering both items, the site will be installed. You should not
see any error messages.

The webserver does NOT need to be restarted. The frontpage extensions should
be immediately available.

* Upgrade
From time to time, a site may need to be upgraded. This may need to be done
when a new version of frontpage extensions becomes available, or at times
for an unknown reason, apache fails to recognize the frontpage extensions and
the site will need an upgrade to correct the issue. The command to perform
this is 

  mkfp --upgrade DOMAIN.COM

* Change the Password for an Apache Frontpage site.
Another option which may need to be edited on an Apache Frontpage Site is the
Frontpage Username or Password used to administrate the web. This must be 
done from the command line and uses the standard 'htpasswd' syntax. 
The password file for the site resides in

 /www/DOMAIN/pub/public_html/_vti_pvt/service.pwd

This file will contain two items, a comment noting the file is Frontpage 
owned, and the entry for the username. An example would be:

 # -FrontPage-
 des:R6mPzCGFOl0ls

To change the password for the existing username, change directory in the 
'_vti_pvt' for the domain you would like to effect. Issue the command

 htpasswd service.pwd USER

Substitute the actual username for USER. You will be prompted to enter the
new password and then confirm it by typing it again. Once you have done so,
the new password should be immediately available.

* Change the Username for an Apache Frontpage site.
In the event that the username for administrating an Apache Frontpage site
needs to be changed, the following steps should be followed.

 1. change diretory to /www/DOMAIN/pub/public_html/_vti_pvt for the domain
    you would like to effect

 2. edit the service.pwd file and remove the line that contains the current
    username. In the example above, you would remove the following line:

     des:R6mPzCGFOl0ls

 3. Run the htpasswd command using the new user's name.

      htpasswd service.pwd USER

 4. Look in the service.pwd file to verify that there is an entry for the
    new username.

 5. Next edit the service.grp file. Replace the old username with the new.
    An example of the file would be:

     # -FrontPage-
     administrators: des
     authors:

The change should be immediate.
