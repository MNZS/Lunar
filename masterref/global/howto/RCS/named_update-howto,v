When a new client has been added or removed from hostX server, the following
scripts MUST be ran on the hostX server:

  sudo /usr/local/lunarbin/mkslave
  sudo /usr/local/lunarbin/zoneupdate

These script should be ran in THAT order. 

mkslave
This script creates a slave named.<hostname> file that is appropriate 
for the nameX servers. It is held on the hostX machine in /var/named
with the filename slave_<hostname>.

zoneupdate
This script sends the local slave_<hostname> file to name1 and name2. The
file is copied on the remote machine as /var/named/named.<hostname>.
This script also creates the files /var/named/run/named.go and /etc/named/
run/relay.go on the remote nameX server.

named.go
This file is created on the nameX server and is looked for by the script
named_update.pl. 

named_update.pl
This script looks in /var/named/run for a file called named.go
If this file is present, named_update.pl will restart named in order
to read in the new named.hostX files

relay.go
This file is create on the nameX server and is looked for by the script 
mkrelay.pl

mkrelay.pl
This script looks in /var/named/run for a file called relay.go
If this file is present, the script will create a new /etc/mail/relay-domains
file to ensure the nameserver can provide backup mail services for a current
list of hosted domain. The script then restarts Sendmail using the mkmail.pl
script.
