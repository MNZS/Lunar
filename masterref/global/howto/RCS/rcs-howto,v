SYNOPSIS
  Describes how to use RCS protected files using the rcedit application
  or manually using ci and co with the editor of your choice.

USAGE
  RCS allow for a file to have automatic backups of each edited revision
  made. The copies are not flat file copies. Rather they are special 
  single files that hold the differences between each revision. The special
  file are present in the RCS directory that resides in the same directory
  as the file being protected.

  If you prefer 'vi' as your editor, you can simply type

    rcedit <filename>

  To access the file via RCS and archive the file. If you prefer to
  use an alternate editor, you'll need to perform the checkout and 
  checkin procedure manually. 

    co -l <filename>
      Use this command to checkout a file for editing. This should be
      done when a file already exists within RCS.

  After you have the file checked out, you can edit it using the editor
  of your choice. Proceed with the usual steps and commit your changes.
  Once you are through editing the file, you will need to check it back
  into RCS, so the file will be archived.

    ci -u <filename>
      Use this command to commit your changes to the file to the RCS
      archives. This command can also be used to check a file into RCS
      for the first time ever.

  You will be prompted to add a comment on the changes you are making.
  Once you have added your comment, you may then exit the comment screen
  by typing a single period on an empty line and hitting the return key.
  This will complete the process.

  To view the log entries for a particular file, you may enter the 
  command

    rlog <filename>

  You may want to pipe this to more as for some files it may be quite
  extensive.

KNOWN BUGS
  Not all files are RCS protected. If you are curious to know if a file
  is protected. you can run 'ls RCS' to see a listing of the files under
  protection. The output will be a list of files followed by ',v'. The
  ',v' is just a flag showing the file is an RCS Archive file. If you do
  not see your file in the list, it is not RCS protected.
