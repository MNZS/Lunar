The Reference System allows for a repository of files to be maintained
as master copies which are then copied to multiple locations to be used
by various applications. This will allow for a change in a single copy 
to be immediately propogated across applications using it. 

The Reference System is a Local system and used to copy files on a single
machine. The Reference System repository is located in /usr/local/ref.
Files held in this directory are copied to various locations on the server
for use by applications. Some examples would be 

 phpMyAdmin
 Miva 
 Control Panel
 Hosting cgi-bin

Typically these files are propogated to their respective areas through a
script which automates the procedure and limits the possibility of typos
and other mistakes. Some of these scripts are

 ref.pl
 newclient.pl

In a multiple server environment, the challenge is escalated to keep a
consistency in files that are identical on several hosts. For this purpose
the Master Reference System is used. The Master Reference System is held
on masterref.lunarhosting.net. The file repository is held in the directory
/usr/local/masterref.
The Master Reference System hold a number of files and directories which
are essentially identical across all Lunar Hosting servers. They are held
in their pristine state in the file repository. Once a change is made to a
file or a file added/removed, the change must then be propogated to all
servers in the network. This is achieved via the script

 /usr/local/masterbin/masterref.pl

The masterref.pl script read in a finite list of files and directories which
are to be copied across all servers. This list is called the sources file 
and can be found at

 /usr/local/masterbin/sources

This file is extremely important and should be edited carefully! Details on
the file syntax are held within the file itself.

In all cases where a file can be made globally identical across servers, it
should be held in the Master Reference System.


With multiple servers, there are certain files that will be identical
across each host. When a change is made to one of these files, it 
becomes tedious to maintain consistency. In times of emergency, a file
needing to be updated immediately to all hosts, will need to be manually
copied.
