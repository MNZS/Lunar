SYNOPSIS  
  New users are added to the system through the command "newuser". This
  should be considered a full replacement for "useradd" when it comes to
  client accounts. The need for "newuser" came because of the very lengthy
  command line syntax that would be used via useradd for new client accounts.
  
  Each new client must be a member of two additional groups in order to allow
  them full rights to update and manage their website. In addition, client
  accounts also have their shell set to /bin/false and their home directory
  set to a sub directory of their domain. In short, the command line option
  using the normal useradd binary would appear as follows:
  
    useradd \
      -d /home/clients/DOMAIN/USERNAME \
      -s /bin/false \
      -c "User's Name" \
      -G hosting,GROUP \
      USERNAME
      
  All this, and the administrator would still need to update the user's 
  password using the passwd() command. The new "newuser" command will prompt
  the administrator for a domain name, after which, all users added will be
  associated with that client domain.
  
  When adding users, read through each prompt you are given to enter
  information.

  If you are unclear of what you should be entering, you can safely Ctrl-c out
  of the script without having any system files touched.

USAGE
  Simply type "newuser" as root and answer the questions. Once you have added
  users, try "finger username" to ensure that they are configured as you
  expected.

  Answering Y to "Does user need Admin Powers?" will place the user in the
  adm_ group for the domain. Answering Y to "Does user need FTP Powers?" 
  will place the user in the ftp_ group for the domain.
  
KNOWN BUGS
  When adding a user, the group for their domain must exist prior to the
  user being added to the system. In other words, when adding a user for
  the domain "www.ic-solutions.net", the group "ic-solutions" must already
  exist in the /etc/group file. Make sure it is there.
