This document deals with adding the Urchin Web Statistics reports to a
customer's website.

Lunar Hosting makes use of Quantified Systems' web statistics program 
called "urchin" to provide customers with details about traffic coming
to their website. The number of licenses for Urchin is limited, so it
must be enabled on a per customer basis upon their request.

* Installation
To enable Urchin for a domain, simply create a file called 'urchin' in
the /etc/hosting-options/DOMAIN directory, where DOMAIN is substituted
with the actual customer's domain (e.g. "lunarmedia.net"). One this file
is in place, the customer will have urchin statistics as of midnight that
very evening.

* Viewing
All POP3 user accounts configured for a domain will have privelages to
log into the Urchin portion of the website to view statistics. The URL 
viewing may be accessed directly through

  https://www.DOMAIN/stats/

Or it can be access through a link in the domain's control panel. The
link in the control panel is in the left hand column of hyperlinks. This
link is only present for domain's which have an 'urchin' file present
in /etc/hosting-optiosn/DOMAIN

* Statistics creation and logs 
Once an 'urchin' file is put into place, the domain is added to the 
Urching configuration file (/usr/local/urchin/config). This file is 
rewritten everyday to accomodate new domains which have urchin enabled.
This process is achieved through the 'mkurchin' script which runs each
day at 23:30.
Urchin itself runs at 00:00 each day. As the application runs, it takes
each domain's log and archives it with -YYYYMMDD appended to the end of
it. It then sends a HUP1 signal to apache to gracefully restart the 
daemon so that new logfiles may be created. 
If any configuration changes have been added to Apache that will require
a full stop/startssl restart, this graceful restart through Urchin will
fail! This means that the server will be down starting at midnight!

IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES MADE TO APACHE DURING THE DAY THAT REQUIRE A
FULL STOP AND STARTSSL RESTART, DO SO BEFORE URCHIN RUNS!!

See the apache_start-howto file for more information on what requires a
full stop/startssl restart and what can be handled via a graceful restart.
