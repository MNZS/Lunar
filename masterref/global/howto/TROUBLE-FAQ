This file is meant as a repository of problems that have come up which
have caused customers major problems and have not had an obvious fix:


*** SHOPZONE **************
Q. Shopzone refuses to pull up any shopping cart pages. The error
   coming up shows 'internal error'

A. The access log for the site has become corrupted
   1. cd /www/DOMAIN/pub/private_html/db/
   2. Look for *.bad files. If they exist remove them using 'rm -f'
   3. If they do not exist, rename the ACCESSLOG.cdx and ACCESSLOG.dbf
      files. 'mv ACCESSLOG.cdx ACCESSLOG.cdx-bad'
   4. Test to ensure that the website is running properly.



*** PHP **************
Q. Customer is passing variables from an html form to a PHP script and 
   the variables do not appear to reach the script.

A. As of PHP 4.2.x the engine variable 'register_globals' has been set to
   'off' by default. This means that in order to use the variables passed
   to the php script, the variables need to be localized. 
   The customer *should* change their script to accomodate this feature
   since it was turned off for security purposes. The following web page
   discusses the matter further:
   
   http://us2.php.net/register_globals

   If the client does not want to do this, or needs for the scripts to 
   work immediately, you can enable this feature on a per website basis.

   1. cd /usr/local/apache/conf/include/features/global/
   2. vi http.DOMAIN and https.DOMAIN for the client's website
   3. uncomment the line that enables the ICB include
   4. cd /usr/local/apache/conf/include/features/icb/
   5. create or edit http.DOMAIN and https.DOMAIN for the clients website
   6. add the following to the file
        php_flag register_globals on
   7. gracefully restart apache
   8. tail the /apachelog file to ensure it restarts correctly
   9. test the clients script.
