Lunar Hosting webmail is handled by the open source software Squirrel Mail.
To install squirrelmail, the following packages need to be installed:

  squirrelmail
  imap

Since Apache is compiled by hand on our servers, a 'apache' group does not
exist by default. Squirrelmail when installed as an RPM, tries to apply 
group permissions to directories it uses as 'apache'. Make sure that the 
'apache' group exists in /etc/group as:

  apache:x:48:nobody

It should appear exactly as above.
