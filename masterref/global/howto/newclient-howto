SYNOPSIS
  Adding new clients to the Lunar Hosting server is achieved by running a
  single script to begin the process. This script is called "newclient"
  and must be ran as root.

USAGE
  To add a brand new client, run:

    newclient --add --domain domain.com

  To add a new client brought by a reseller, run:

    newclient --add --domain domain.com --reseller reseller_id

  To remove an existing client, run:

    newclient --remove --domain domain.com

  Care needs to be taken when running this tool as it affects nearly 
  every service that we use on the server. Moreover, the --remove is
  particulary deadly since it will remove all of the files associated
  with that client. In order to retrive them, we would need to restore
  them from the offsite backup.

  Once the script has completed running, it will provide a list of final
  steps that need to take place in order to finish the setup.

  See the resellers-howto file for more information on the --reseller
  flag and what acceptable options are.

KNOWN BUGS
  One problem with the script is that the new "groupadd" utility that
  ships with redhat will not add group names longer than 16 characters.
  During the install process, two groups are added. Each group is based
  on the customer's domain name: "customer.com"

  The groups added are:

    customer
    adm_customer
    ftp_customer
    tmp_customer

  If the customer's domain is over 16 characters, the groupadd part of
  the script will fail, and these domains will need to be added manually.
  This can be done by editing the /etc/group file and adding the two 
  groups by hand. Take care to keep the proper syntax and increment the
  groupnumber so that they are unique in the list.
