This document covers the backup and restoration process for Lunar 
Hosting servers.

Each morning at 03:30, the nameX servers run a script called 
archive-system.pl. This script is a simple wrapper that ensures the
script is being ran on a nameX server and then calls a shell script,
archive-system.sh for each host in the network. All servers are backed
up to name2, however name2's files are backed up to name1.

All web data is held in /usr/local/archives/<hostname>/<date>/

All system data is held in /usr/local/archives/<hostname>/system/
