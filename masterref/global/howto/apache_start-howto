SYNOPSIS
  This document covers how to start and stop the apache server

USAGE
  The command used by apache to handle starting/stopping of the daemon
  is as follows:

    /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl <option>

  ** When a server is rebooted ****************************************
  The apache server does not start by default on a server reload. You 
  will need to do so manually

    /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl startssl

  You will be prompted for either one or two passwords. The first phrase
  is 'motion'. The second is 'Madeline1933'

  ** Adding a new client **********************************************
  A client added to the apache config should be followed by the
  following syntax:

    /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl configtest

  If this returns an 'OK' response, then it should be followed by:

    /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl stop
    /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl startssl

  The start keyword will prompt you to enter the passphrases associated
  with the domain certificates. The first passphrase is 'motion'. The
  second passphrase is 'Madeline1933'.

  ** Changing the config of an existing client ************************
  A change made to an existing client's configuration will not be made
  active until the server is forced to re-read the configuration files.
  This can be done without interrupting traffic by:

    /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl configtest

  If this returns an 'OK' response, then it should be followed by:

    /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl graceful

  ** Summary of commands **********************************************
  To start, stop and test the apache server the following commands
  summarize the key options:

    startssl 	- this will start the server with ssl support. you 
                  should ALWAYS use this method to start the server.
                  Do NOT, and I mean NEVER use "start". This will
                  start the server without SSL support, which would
                  be a very bad thing.

                  when starting the server, you will be prompted for
                  a certificate password. this password is "motion"

    start	- do NOT use this command! it only starts the server on
		  port 80 and does enable ssl support.

    stop 	- this will stop the server forcibly. this should ONLY
           	  be used when you are enabling a brand new customer!

    graceful 	- use this to restart the server when a change has
               	  been made in the config but a new client has NOT 
               	  been added

    configtest 	- use this to check the current apache config to 
                  see whether there is a syntax error. always do
                  this before starting/stopping apache

KNOWN BUGS
  There are a couple of gotchas with starting and stopping apache.
  The configtest is a good method for checking to see if a configuration
  file is in good syntax, but it doesnt check ssl certificate keys.
  If a key has an incorrect passphrase the server will crash and the
  error would not be found with configtest.
