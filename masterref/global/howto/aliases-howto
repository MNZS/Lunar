The /etc/aliases file should not be edited by hand. This file is built
via the 'mkmail' script from include files held within 

  /etc/mail/include/aliases/*

These include files should seldomly be edited by hand, but may be in 
cases where administrative intervention is necessary. Each domain has
their own alias.DOMAIN file within this directory. These files should
be owned by 'nobody' to allow for editing through the control panel.

If one of these files is edited, mkmail should be ran immediately after
to put the change into effect.
