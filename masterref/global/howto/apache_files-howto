SYNOPSIS
  A summary of the apache directory and file structure

USAGE
  The apache server is set up with a root directory of

    /usr/local/apache/

  Within this directory, only a single directory is of importance
  with regards to configuration management.

    /conf/

  In the configuration directory, there are three two files that will
  seldom be manually configured, but should be discussed:

    httpd.conf
    domains.conf

  Th httpd.conf file is the main server configuration and also holds
  the configuration for the lunarhosting 80 and 443 sites. This file 
  will seldomly be touched and should only be done so by an admin who
  is very familiar with how apache works and how our specific configuration
  calls other files.

  The domains.conf file is list of "Include" statements which call the
  site specific configurations. Some statements are commented out. These
  are typically either Frontpage enabled websites or sites that have 
  been temporarily taken out of production for one reason or another.

  Frontpage websites are the only exception to the rule when it comes to
  website configurations that reside in the main 'httpd.conf' file. The
  Frontpage Server extensions application requires that these configs 
  be present in the main httpd.conf file. Therefore any frontpage domains
  will be commented out in the domains.conf file.
