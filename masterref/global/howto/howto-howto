SYNOPSIS
  This file describes how to create howto files.

USAGE
  Copy the file called "template" to a suitable name for the project
  you are going to discuss.

    cp template <project>-howto

  Once this is done, edit the file using rcedit

    rcedit <project>-howto

  This will place you into the rcedit script. This is just the normal
  vi editor. If you would prefer to use pico rather than vi, you can 
  follow this process.

  First, edit the file with pico. then check the file into RCS by
 
    ci -u <project>-howto

  Once you check the file into RCS, you will need to add a comment
  to describe the file. Add your remarks and type a single period
  on an empty line to complete the process.
