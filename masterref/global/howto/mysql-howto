To enable MySQL support for a customer several items must be completed:

1. Add a new database
  - As root, or with sudo privelages type 'mysql' on the commandline of the
    host where the domain is located.
  - type 'create database DOMAIN1;'
    make sure to substitute the domain for DOMAIN1. leave off the tld portion
    of the domain. for example, to create the database for lunarhosting.net
    you would type: 'create database lunarhosting1;'
  - create a user to administrate the database
    type the following on the mysql> commandline
    'grant all on DOMAIN1.* to USER@host1.lunarhosting.net identified by PASS;'
    make sure that DOMAIN1 is substituted for the real database name.
    USER can be anything that you would like it to be as long as it is unique
    in the mysql database. i generally take the domain name and add 'sql' to
    the beginning of it, or 'admin' to the end. for example, for the admin of
    the lunarhosting.net database, the user would be 'sqllunarhosting'. You
    may want to try and keep the user to 8 characters. So, perhaps 'sqllunar'
    would be a better choice.
    The PASS can be substituted with any 8 characters.
  - Create a authentication file for the tool:
    # cp /www/DOMAIN/controlpanel/.htaccess /www/DOMAIN/options/mysql
  - Make sure to write down the database name, user name and password. Put
    this info in a file called 'mysql' held in the following directory:
      /etc/hosting-options/DOMAIN.COM/
    This info should be passed along to the client so they may be able to 
    access the database through their scripts.

2. Enable phpMyAdmin
   This tool allows for client to admin their database using a web front end.
 - Copy the phpMyAdmin files to the client's directory structure
    # cp -a /ref/options/mysql /www/DOMAIN/options/
 - Change into the new directory
    # cd /www/DOMAIN/options/mysql
 - Edit the config.inc.php file
   Look for the following keywords in the file and change them to the correct
   parameters: DOMAIN USERNAME PASSWORD
 - Enable phpMyAdmin in apache
   # cd /usr/local/apache/conf/include/features/global
   Edit the https.DOMAIN file for the client
   Uncomment the Include line for mysql
 - Create the Apache MySQL include
   # cd /usr/local/apache/conf/include/features/mysql/
   # cp template sql.DOMAIN
   Edit the sql.DOMAIN file
   Replace the DOMAIN words in the file with the correct domain
 - Gracefully restart apache. See the apache-howto file on the procedure.
 - Try to reach the mysqladmin page:
    https://www.DOMAIN/sqladmin/
