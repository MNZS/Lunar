PayFlow Pro is a Verisign service which allows for live-time credit card
transaction processing. This is a paid service through Verisign that can
be integrated into Miva Empresa.
To be eligible for using PayFlow Pro, a customer much first register with
Verisign for the service. Once registered, the customer will set up their
MerchantID and other information with Verisign. The customer will also be
given a login for 

 https://manager.verisign.com/

Through this login, we may download the PayFlowPro library to be used with 
Miva. This file will have a name similar to

 PFProMiva.so

PayFlow Pro is known as a Commerce Method in Miva syntax. In order for a
website to be eligible to use PayFlowPro, an Apache environment variable
needs to be set up defining it.

To set up this variable, first edit the domain's Apache include for Miva.
This is located in:

 /usr/local/apache/conf/include/commerce/miva/mv.DOMAIN

In this file, you will want to edit the last line which is a call to an
ICB commerce include file. The include line references:

 /usr/local/apache/conf/include/commerce/icb/icb.DOMAIN

This file should include the following information:

## payflo pro commerce library
SetEnv MvCONFIG_COMMERCE_PNTRANSACT     /full/path/to/PFProMiva.so 

(This location has yet to be determined.)

One caveat that was found to exist is the lack of a CERT variable defined
for access via PayFlowPro. As a result, a symlink MUST be created in the 
current miva-bin directly to /usr/local/miva/certs
