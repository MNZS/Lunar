Apt-get is now used in place of Red Hat's up2date utility for keeping 
the system's packages current with the most recent available as related
through RedHat's FTP site (or in our case, a mirror).

Upgrading packages on the server is a two step process. The first being
a dry run of the upgrade allowing you to view what packages would be 
upgraded on a production run of the script.

  # first update our system with a new list of packages from the 
  # remote server
  apt-get update

  # run the upgrade script with a -S flag for a 'dry-run'
  apt-get -S upgrade

This should display a summary of what changes *would* be made to the server
if apt-get were to be ran in production. If any of the proposed changes are
not to your liking, you can add the package to be skipped to the list of 
"hold" packages in the /etc/apt/apt.conf file. An example would be:

  HoldPkgs {"^php*"; "^mod_jk*"; };

Make sure that you edit the apt.conf file using the 'rcedit' script!
Fields can be either a regular expression or a full package name. Once the
package has been added to the HoldPkgs list, run the dry-run script again
to make sure that the package will not be installed

  apt-get -S upgrade

If the output is now as you expect it to be, run the real upgrade

  apt-get upgrade

Pay special attention to what packages are upgraded. At times packages will
cause some applications to segfault. Be sure to look at the logs for Apache,
Sendmail and Named. Ensure that each application is running as expected.
