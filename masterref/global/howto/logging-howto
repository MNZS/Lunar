*Urchin
Websites that use Urchin for log reporting are rotated on a daily basis
during each Urchin run. A site's log for the day is archived as the log
filename with the current date appended in the format YYYYMMDD.
These archived logs are held for 5 days. The urchin_logrotate.pl script
will delete the archived log files, from 5 days prior, for each urchin 
enabled domain.
