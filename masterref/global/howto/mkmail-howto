SYNOPSIS
  This file covers the usage and working of the mkmail perl script.

USAGE
  The mkmail script is generally ran strictly through its cron job
  which runs at 5, 11, 17 and 23 hours. However, if a change is made
  to the sendmail configuration of any of its file held within /etc/mail,
  the mkmail script should be ran to restart the daemon.
  The mkmail script should be looked upon as a full replacement for the
  /etc/rc3.d/S80sendmail init script. This init script should NEVER be
  ran directly.
  The mkmail script builds the /etc/aliases file and /etc/mail/virtusertable
  files from include files held within /etc/mail/include/*

  To run the script, as root:

    # mkmail.pl

  You should see output similar to

  Shutting down sendmail:                                    [  OK  ]
  /etc/aliases: 26 aliases, longest 26 bytes, 319 bytes total

  Generally any errors will be printed to the screen. You can verify that
  sendmail is running correctly by telnetting to the local machine on port
  25

  # telnet localhost 25
  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
