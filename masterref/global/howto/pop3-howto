The POP3 daemon used by Lunar Hosting is QPopper by Qualcomm. The tool's 
homepage is found at: http://www.eudora.com/qpopper/
The current release of the tool can be downloaded from the website or 
from its FTP site: ftp.qualcomm.com/eudora/servers/unix/popper/

Installing the tool requires a typical configure, make, make install. The
configure options should be as follows:

./configure     --disable-check-pw-max \
                --enable-timing \
                --enable-nonauth-file=/etc/qpopper/nonauth \
                --enable-shy \
                --enable-specialauth \
                --with-openssl

Once installed. A directory called /etc/qpopper should be created on the 
server where the daemon will run. A file called 'config' should be created
with the following contents:

set downcase-user
set trim-domain
set reverse-lookup
set statistics

A second file called config-tls should also be created in /etc/qpopper with 
the following as its content:

set tls-support = alternate-port
set tls-private-key-file = /etc/qpopper/certs/name2.lunarhosting.net.key
set tls-server-cert-file = /etc/qpopper/certs/name2.lunarhosting.net.cert-priv
set downcase-user
set trim-domain
set reverse-lookup
set statistics

Finally, to activate the pop3 and pop3s services, create two files in 
/etc/xinetd.d. Each file should be called by their service name respectively.

/etc/xinetd.d/pop3s:
service pop3s
{
        socket_type             = stream
        protocol                = tcp
        wait                    = no
        user                    = root
        server                  = /usr/local/sbin/popper
        server_args             = qpopper -f /etc/qpopper/config-tls
        disable                 = no
}

/etc/xinetd.d/pop3:
service pop3
{
        socket_type             = stream
        protocol                = tcp
        wait                    = no
        user                    = root
        server                  = /usr/local/sbin/popper
        server_args             = qpopper -f /etc/qpopper/config
        disable                 = no
}

Once this has been completed, restart xinetd through its init script located
in /etc/init.d
The server should now be listening on TCP/110 and TCP/995
