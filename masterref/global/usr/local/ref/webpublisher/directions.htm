<P>You must have HTML Web Publisher installed to use this function. Please contact <a href="mailto:info@lunarmedia.net"><b>info@lunarmedia.net</b></a> if you would like pricing on installation.</P>
<P>You will be limited to the amount of changes you can apply to your web site text. Because this is using a script that will replace the text if the original is deleted, please be careful when you are updating your pages. <b>We can not be held responsible for any deleted information data!</b></P><ol><li>Enter the password "<b>admin</b>" in the password box. Use lower case.
<li>Choose a file to edit from the drop down menu and click EDIT PAGE. If the file you want to edit  is not listed, it may be a document such as a form that we do not recommend changing, or it has not been requested for addition. If you would like to add a new file, please contact <a href="mailto:info@lunarmedia.net">info@lunarmedia.net</a>
<p><b>BASIC HTML TAGS-----</b>
<li>Regular text needs to be formatted or it will continue to run on. You can separate paragraphs by inserting a &lt;P&gt; tag between the paragraphs.
<li>To <b>BOLD </b> an item, you must surround the text with two tags. For example &lt;B&gt;<b>WORD</b>&lt;/B&gt;</li>
<li>To apply <i>ITALICS</i> you must surround the text with two tags. For example &lt;I&gt;<i>WORD</i>&lt;/I&gt;</li>
<li> To apply both bold and Italics, you can apply both tags around each other &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;<i><b>WORD</b></i>&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;</li>
<li>To center text you can use &lt;div align="center"&gt;WORD&lt;/div&gt; tags around the word. You must CLOSE the tags to make the browser stop applying the effect you have commanded it to do.</li>
<li>If you would like to shrink text, you must apply a set of tags such as &lt;font size="-2"&gt;<font size="-2">text</font>&lt;/font&gt;</li>
<li>If you would like to enlarge text, you must apply a set of tags such as &lt;font size="+1"&gt;<font size="+1">text</font>&lt;/font&gt;</li>
<li>If you would like to add a bullet before an item, use the &lt;li&gt;tags before the bulleted word </li>
<li>If you would like to add an HTML link to an external web site, you                                        
can add it by surrounding the words you would like to be highlighted                                          
with the URL. For example:                                                                                    
&lt;a href="http://www.lunarmedia.net"&gt;<b>Lunar Media Web                                                  
Site</b>&lt;/a&gt;
<li>If you would like to add an image, we suggest contacting us before attempting to make such a drastic change to your layout. If you have already spoken with us and would like to insert a new image, please make sure your image is FTP'd to the server. There is a tutorial on FTP in your control panel. <p>The proper code for adding images is &lt;img src="images/imagename.gif" alt="" width="236" height="238" border="0"&gt;  If you do not know the width and height of your image, you may omit this from the code, however, it will not load as fast.  The folder you put your images in is named images by default. If you have a different folder that the images are contained in, you would replace the word "images" with the title of that folder.</p>
</li>
<p>
<li>If you have multiple areas of text in your site, they will be separated. This is to prevent any errors in the HTML code.</li>
<li>Once you make all of your changes, click on Submit Changes</li>
<li>Your page will refresh reflecting the new pages. You can click on the link above to view your page, or click LOG OUT, or MAIN MENU to return to the list of documents able to be edited.</li>
</ol>

<b>NOTE: Be very careful in your selection, you can not undo once you click SUBMIT.</b></font>
