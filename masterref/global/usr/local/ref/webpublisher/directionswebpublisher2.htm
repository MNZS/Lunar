<p>PLEASE READ OVER THE ENTIRE TUTORIAL CAREFULLY BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES TO YOUR WEB SITE. We do not support this program other than any errors you may be receiving from our server. If you need additional training on WebPublisher, please contact us for an estimate. 

<P>
<li>We assume you have already downloaded CuteFTP from <a href="http://www.globalscape.com"> <b>Global Scape</b></a> and have installed it.  
<li>There are more specifi directions on the Global Scape web site on how to use this program, or you can follow a tutorial we have published for our e-zine at <a href="http://www.lunareclipse.net/cuteftp.htm">Eclipse Ezine</a> We have bulleted the main points below.  If you are unsure of your domain name, username or password, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@lunarmedia.net"><b>support@lunarmedia.net</b></a>

<ol><li>Open CuteFTP. Your FTP Host Address is your domain name such as www.yourdomain.com. Your FTP user name and password are the same as what you used to log into your control panel. If you are experiencing problems using that user name and password, please <a href="mailto:support@lunarmedia.net"><b>contact us</b></a>
<li>Click Connect. Once connected you will see folders or files appear on the left side of your monitor.
<li>Open up your Public HTML folder (or other folder if you have been specified to do so)  by double clicking on it. This will be on the right column of the screen.
<li>On the left side, click on the open folder button(in yellow) and the drop down menu until you can navigate to the folder you want to upload from, or download to.
<li>Moving files from your computer to the server is considered<b> UPLOADING</b>. Moving files from the server to your computer is considered <b>DOWNLOADING</b>. You can double click on the files on the left to download to the right, or click on the files on the left to upload to the right.  You can also click once on the files and drag to the left or right. If you would like to select multiple files, you can hold down your CTRL key to select multiple files to upload or download.
<li>You may have been provided a template, which will also be up on the server for archive purposes. You can download the original file from the server and rename it if you have lost your template. To do this, download the file to the right of the screen, click once on the name of the file and it will allow you to change the name of the file on your local computer. <b>PLEASE MAKE SURE TO LEAVE THE EXTENSION .htm </b> after the name. Once you have altered it, you can re-upload it to the server. You will now want to edit it in WebPublisher.
</ol>


<li>You will be still be limited to the amount of changes you can apply to your web site text when you add new pages using our templates. Because this is using a script that will replace the text if the original is deleted, please be careful when you are updating your pages. <b>We can not be held responsible for any deleted information data!</b></P>

<ol><li>First, you must add your new document to the list of editable files in WebPublisher once it has been uploaded through CuteFTP. If the document you uploaded does NOT have web publisher tags in it, it will not be able to be edited in WebPublisher.  Please contact us if you would like web publisher tags added.
<li>Click on<b> EDIT YOUR HTML PAGES</b> from the menu bar in your control panel.

<li>Instead of entering the password "admin" in the password box(<i>which is called SLAVE MODE</i>), use the additional password we have provided you. This will take you to a new screen. Use lower case. If you simply want to edit you exsisting pages, use "admin" still.
<li>Click <b>Log In</b>
<li>Under "Add File to editable file list", you will see a link such as /www/yourdomainname.com/pub/public_html/
<li>Type the name of the document after the last slash so it will appear as   <b>/www/yourdomainname.com/pub/public_html/newdocument.htm</b>
<li> Click <b>ADD A FILE</b>
<li> If the file has not been uploaded or there is a problem in the spelling, you will get an error. Please check to see that you have uploaded the file(by logging into CuteFTP and seeing it on the right side of the screen. If your file has been uploaded it will say "
<i>New file /www/yourdomainname.com/pub/public_html/newdocument.htm added and chmoded to 0777</i>"
<li>Once you have finished adding your files, click on the <b>LOG OUT </b>button. 
<li> To edit the files, you can now log back in with the user name "admin"
