Version 1.0.0pre2 released June 5, 2000
* Lots of things have changed in this release, and I'd like to give a very
  special thanks to Juerg Raess <jraess@oxygen.ch> for the many great changes
  and additions. While I have not incorporated all the changes he made, I have
  incorporated the majority of them, and W3Mail now sports a much nicer look
  and feel thanks to Juerg.  So once again Juerg, thank you so very much, this
  is what makes open source so beautiful.
* install.pl has been removed.  I didn't feel that it worked very well, and
  was too much of a hassle, if someone would like to redo it please feel free.
* w3admin.cgi no longer works.  It needs to be redone..
* added html.top and html.end
* added subroutines &PrintTop and &PrintTail to vars-file

  printed out in changed that way: Deleted the two lines:
   print $pop->Head(1);
   print $pop->Message();

* Preview of messages now works with correct linebreaks (<xmp>-tag)

  reading (plain-text) and previewing messages.

  wrapped to 75 if text/plain, less errors with html-emails

  Add Recipient will fill in as default value, to be able to make
  changes.  Invalid email-addresses are not accepted anymore.
  Support for the sign @ in name.

  Sendmail-changes were quite tricky, but now one can
  even read the messages correct after they are sent.

* Added change-button in preview in order to be able to change 
  the message again.
* Avoid POP-Lock-Busy:
  Often there were two pop-connections open. To avoid the
  pop-lock busy (script will fail then...) the connections are
  closed every time.
  combined in inbox.cgi ($pop->Close();) and showmessage.cgi
