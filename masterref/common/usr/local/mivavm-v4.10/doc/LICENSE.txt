This License is between You and Miva.  You acknowledge that Miva is granting 
and has granted this License in reliance upon representations made by You and 
You warranty the truthfulness and accuracy of such representations.  Any breach 
of this warranty of truthfulness and accuracy shall constitute a breach of this 
License.  Miva has the sole and unqualified right to refuse to License any person 
or entity for any reason, except for reasons which are specifically prohibited by 
state and national laws and statutes.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Miva grants you the non-
exclusive, non-transferable and limited License to make an exact copy of the 
Software and install the copy as required for You to execute binary object code 
created by the Miva Script Compiler.  You may make copies and distribute the 
Software or provide access to the Software as long as a) the recipient of the copy 
agrees to this License electronically or in writing; b) You record the contact 
information of the recipient; and c) You clearly label the Software as the property 
of Miva Corporation.

The Software contains valuable proprietary rights of Miva. There is no transfer to 
You of any title to or ownership of the Software or any copyright, trade name, 
trade secret, source code, or other proprietary rights relating to the Software, 
regardless of the form that The Software exists in. You may not violate these 
rights, and You must take all appropriate steps to protect Miva's rights. You

You breach any term or condition of this License.  You agree that in the event of 
a breach of this License, and upon the demand thereof by Miva, You will 
immediately cease any further use of the Software and You will cease any use

necessary to prevent further damages, and that You will not oppose any 
reasonable request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or 
other relief sought by Miva in the event of a breach of this License. Miva shall not

distribution in violation of the terms of this License, and You agree that any 
breach of this License and damages resulting therefrom shall relate back to the 
first and earliest breach thereof.  Failure of Miva to enforce its rights pursuant to 
this License shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, and shall not prejudice 
Miva in any later enforcement of its rights or rights to seek damages therefrom.

HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES.

License on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or 
such provision on any other occasion. This License may only be amended by a
