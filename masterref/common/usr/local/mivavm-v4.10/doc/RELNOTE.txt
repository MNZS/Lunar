Bug Fixes
---------

o  LinkPoint commerce libraries now entity encode text such as company 
   names and other billing information, to enable customers with characters
   such as "&" in their names to work correctly.

o  If the LinkPoint commerce library is not explicitly passed 
   req_addrnum field, the req_baddr1 field MUST contain a digit
   or list of contiguous digits, or an "Invalid billing address 
   information"

o  If the req_addrnum field is explicitly passed to the LinkPoint
   commerce library, it cannot be blank or zero.


New Features
------------

o  Support for FreeBSD4 with pthreads.

o  MvCONFIG_FLAGS_REDIRECTONLY, if set (to any value) will cause the
   environment based config to do a redirect-check and refuse to run if not
   running under Apache redirect.

o  MvCONFIG_VALIDEXTENSIONS, if set, contains a comma-separated list of
   extensions that are allowed.
