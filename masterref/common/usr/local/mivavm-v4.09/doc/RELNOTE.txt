Release Notes

The Miva Virtual Machine 4.09, released August 2003, includes the following:

Bug Fixes
---------

o  The AuthorizeNet commerce library now correctly parses the whole
   message returned from the server, and includes the x_delim_char and
   x_delim_data fields.
o  The AuthorizeNet commerce library now correctly calculates the MD5
   hash sum.
o  The modulo operator ("MOD") now properly traps for division by zero.
o  The builtin function glosub_array no longer returns a null string when
   one or more of the replacement strings isn't found.
o  The 3.x compatibility API routine miva_file_resolve executes correctly when
   MvCONFIG_DIR_COMMERCE was not set.
o  The time_t system variable on Microsoft Windows platforms now takes the
   timezone into consideration correctly.
o  The LinkPoint commerce libraries now entity encode product and billing
   information.
o  MvSMTP calls are now correctly dealing with SMTP replies that are longer
   than 256 bytes.
o  If an aggregate variable is stored in an external database variable, the
   variable is serialized (turned into a comma-separated list) first.
o  Testing for public/private keys being loaded is now independant of the
   version of OpenSSL.
o  Storage into an external database variable and then using that variable
   will show the newly assigned value, and not refetch the value from the 
   database.
o  Assigning values to non-existant database fields (or to fields of databases
   that are not open) no longer will cause the VM to crash.

Notification
------------

o  The LinkPoint commerce libraries 4.08 and above [and 3.9601 and above]
   are linked against new LinkPoint libraries, which communicate via port
   1129.  Older version of this commerce librarie used 1139.  A symptom 
   of using the wrong communication port is if purchases result in 
   "CC-2501: Unable to connect to SSL Server" errors.
