## masterref sources 
## list of files and directories held in global stasis on
## masterref.lunarhosting.net which will be updated on remote
## servers

## syntax
## lines beginning with a hash mark are comments
## entries are composed of rsync syntax with source
## followed by a space and then destination

## warning!
## by default masterref will delete any files on the dst 
## directory that are not present in the reference system
## when the src is a directory, ALL files in that directory
## must be held by the reference system. 

## warning!
## be very careful how lines are written. directories should
## be written with a trailing slash (/) in the src portion
## and should reference the same name in the destination, but
## without the slash.

## warning!
## files should be referenced in the src when there are other
## files present in the destination directory that should NOT
## be deleted by masterref.

## example!
## /usr/local/masterref/host2/root/from_masterref /root

## /etc
/usr/local/masterref/common/etc/init.d/mysqld /etc/init.d
/usr/local/masterref/common/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf /etc/proftpd

## miva
/usr/local/masterref/common/usr/local/mivavm-v4.10/ /usr/local/mivavm-v4.10
/usr/local/masterref/common/usr/local/miva /usr/local/miva
